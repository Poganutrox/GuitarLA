## Features

- Add to Cart: Users can add guitars to the cart from the product page.
- Modify Quantity: Users can increase or decrease the quantity of each guitar directly in the cart.
- Clear Cart: Users can completely clear the cart with a single click.
- Dynamic Pricing: The total price of the cart is calculated dynamically as products are added, removed, or their quantities are changed.
- Cart Persistence: The cart content is saved in the browser's local storage, so it persists even if the user closes and reopens the browser.
